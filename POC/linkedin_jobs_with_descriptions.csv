Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role As the Tech Lead for Integrations at Notion, you'll shape how our platform seamlessly connects with the broader software ecosystem. You'll drive the technical vision and execution for secure, scalable, and intuitive integrations with critical enterprise tools—such as Microsoft 365, Atlassian, Salesforce, and Google Workspace. Your work will enable customers to effortlessly incorporate Notion into their daily workflows and maximize its value across their technology stacks. This role is inherently cross-functional, bridging Engineering, Product, Security, Sales, Solutions Engineering, and directly engaging with customers. You’ll craft solutions addressing complex enterprise requirements, laying the groundwork for scalable integration capabilities that support our strategic AI initiatives and customer-centric growth. What You'll Achieve Technical Leadership: Own the full lifecycle of integrations — from technical discovery and architectural design to implementation, rollout, and support. Scalable Systems: Develop robust frameworks and tooling to streamline, accelerate, and secure the delivery of integrations, establishing scalable infrastructure for future growth. Reliability & Quality: Implement rigorous testing, such as synthetic data testing, validation harnesses, and stress testing, ensuring high-quality, reliable integrations. Lead customer co-building initiatives and early-stage deployments to inform iterative improvements. AI & Data Integration: Collaborate closely with the AI Data Ingestion team, enabling intelligent features like Enterprise Search and Q&A through robust, high-quality data pipelines. Documentation & Enablement: Define and uphold best practices for internal and external documentation, empowering developers and partners to easily integrate with, utilize, and extend Notion’s capabilities. Global Collaboration: Coordinate across distributed teams in North America, Europe, and Asia, with occasional international travel (up to quarterly) to align global integration strategies and execution. Skills You'll Need To Bring Proven experience leading engineering teams, including strategic prioritization, technical decision-making, and driving successful product launches. Strong track record building products collaboratively with customers, translating their needs into impactful technical solutions. Exceptional cross-functional collaboration skills, with experience navigating complex, enterprise-focused technical challenges. Nice To Haves Experience developing integrations with key third-party platforms (e.g., Microsoft 365, Atlassian, Salesforce, Google Workspace). Familiarity with building data pipelines supporting AI-driven functionalities. Previous experience in startups or fast-paced technology environments, where you've shaped foundational systems and driven high-impact outcomes. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

Software Engineer,"Software Engineer, Native Windows Development",Notion,"New York, NY",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/software-engineer-native-windows-development-at-notion-4190027181?position=6&pageNum=2&refId=R8Vl8FfZXPg6n2P4ewRa%2Bg%3D%3D&trackingId=ownekOWlPC5QFHra1C4RiA%3D%3D,"About Us We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). About The Role Notion.exe is the Electron-based frame through which many of our most active and engaged users experience Notion. We have several Electron core maintainers on our team to drive cross-platform features and would love to add platform-specific expertise — someone who’s used to working in Visual Studio, with the Windows API, and has opinions about how to best integrate with the world’s most popular operating system. This will help us serve our Windows users, who form the majority of all users and a super-majority of enterprise users, better. What You’ll Achieve You’ll define the roadmap for Windows and enterprise-specific features in Notion for Windows. You’ll help us integrate our classic win32 application with the Windows packaging system, ideally using C++ and native Node.js addons. You’ll build and maintain a fully native installer for Notion’s applications on Windows that’s tiny, fast, and resilient. You'll help build and improve internal tools with simplicity and productivity in mind. We value building high quality apps. We want to build the best possible version of Notion on Windows and want to honor the conventions and possibilities on that platform. You'll improve the performance, reliability, and polish of our Windows app. You will also get to work with the web stack to improve the end-to-end experience. If you’re interested, you have the chance to contribute to or become a maintainer of one of the most-used open source projects - Electron, a cross-platform C++ and Objective-C framework. Electron’s C++ powers 1Password, Figma, Slack, Visual Studio Code, and countless other apps on Windows. Help us make them better! Skills You'll Need To Bring Windows development experience: You have written native Windows applications using Microsoft’s native stack to build applications in the past and want to continue working on the platform. We don’t particularly care if your preferred language of choice is C#, C++, or Rust. Enthusiasm to learn TypeScript, React, and Node.js: While we are primarily looking for Windows expertise, this role will require working with our web stack. No previous experience is required and we’ll provide the guidance and space needed to ramp up. Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same. Nice to Haves You have some experience interacting with the Windows API through C++. You're proficient with other parts of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you. Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $200,000 - $250,000 per year.

This role requires strong Front-End development expertise, the ability to drive UI/UX execution, and a commitment to delivering high-quality, user-focused applications. You will contribute to our core codebase, documentation, and Front-End architecture, ensuring usability, accessibility, and performance. What’s in a title? Here at Two Barrels we don’t take titles very seriously. We know for recruiting purposes we need to call our jobs something, so we started with labeling and differentiating them in a fairly traditional way with “junior, mid, senior”. However, we’ve realized that was putting our employees in a box and wasn’t allowing us to uniquely identify their individual contributions, strengths and professional goals. Once you join our team the titles kinda get dropped as we expect everyone to work with everyone regardless of title or experience. We have taken the approach of evaluating candidates and employees on a “level” basis. It makes it a little easier internally to talk about growing into the next level without there being this huge chasm between what it means to be a Junior Engineer vs. a Mid Engineer. Our levels have expectations set for each one and it’s the responsibility of the manager and employee to make sure there is alignment. We do this through quarterly conversations where we discuss employee progression, if the work is challenging, and to ensure they feel fairly compensated for their work and expertise. Basically, levels gives us more flexibility to help people grow in their careers. But sure, you can post your title on LinkedIn as what makes sense to the rest of the world.

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time. Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service. Our members rely on Netflix to entertain them, and we want to be the first place they go for that entertainment. With an audience of 600M+ and growing, we’re programming for more tastes, cultures and languages than any company has ever done before. It’s why we invest in a wide variety of TV shows and films, and work so hard to make them great. The reach of Netflix and the fandom we create fuels the “Netflix effect” - a virtuous cycle of great content and intense fandom that catapults our stories into the cultural conversation. Netflix influences what people around the world search for and talk about, the music they listen to, the books they read, the countries they visit, and how they dress. Our marketing efforts help to kick start the Netflix effect, and we are providing more and more ways for fans to engage with our stores: Tudum, events like Netflix Bites and Bridgerton experiences, and the launch in 2025 of the first two Netflix House locations. Netflix is a data-driven company, and we are hiring multiple data engineers to increase our data support for marketing and fandom activities around the world. The opportunity for impact in these roles is enormous: Netflix social media channels generate more than 100B impressions a year, we are expanding fandom into the real world, and we’ve barely scratched the surface of the data available to support these activities. What have you done and what do you know? You have 8+ years of experience and proficiency building data pipelines in both batch and real-time settings, to support a variety of use cases. Some of our data sources are small (e.g., sales at Netflix House), and some are enormous (e.g., social media feeds). Our stack is Spark, Flink, Hive/Iceberg, Kafka - experience with these specific technologies is helpful, but not strictly required. You are proficient in Python for scripting, automation, and data orchestration frameworks, and you can write complex SQL (any variant) for ad-hoc and recurring workflows. You strive to write elegant and maintainable code, and you're comfortable picking up new technologies. You understand how to model data efficiently for reporting and metrics, and how to organize data for scale and fast retrieval. You have experience sourcing and modeling data from application APIs. You’ve worked with common data warehouse solutions, such as Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Vertica, Teradata, Greenplum, etc. What will you do? Fully own critical pipelines and data sets to support Netflix efforts around marketing and fandom. Directly collaborate with stakeholders to understand needs, model tables using data warehouse best practices, and develop data pipelines to ensure the timely delivery of high quality data. Creatively explore how to use data to continually add value to Netflix. Translate ambiguous business questions into clear data requirements, and then deliver on them. Be a bridge between data engineering and the business, enabling insights that empower our colleagues to make better and more informed decisions.
